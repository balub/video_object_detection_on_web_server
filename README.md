### Object Detection in Video and Streaming WebÂ Server

In this article, I will present how I managed to use Tensorflow Object-detection API to perform both real-time (webcam) and video post-processing. I used OpenCV with python3 multiprocessing and multi-threading libraries. And This article is dedicated to streaming, an interesting feature that gives Flask applications the ability to provide large responses efficiently partitioned in small chunks, potentially over a long period of time. To illustrate the topic I'm going to show you how to build a live video streaming server!
